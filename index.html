      <h1>The Orca <em>(killer whale, blackfish)</em></h1>
      <p>Orcas are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_predator" target="_blank">apex predators</a>, meaning they themselves have no natural predators. They have a social structure and hunt in groups, like wolves of the sea. These groups are called pods, hunting small and large prey, from fish, seals, dolphins, whales and in one known case, a great white shark. Orcas are more closely related to dolphins rather than whales. They are highly intelligent and have many differnt cultures and dialects. Orcas are known to imitate other things including dolphins, humans and the sounds of boat engines.</p>
      <p>The scientific name <em>Orcinus</em> means "of the kingdom of the dead."</p>

      <h1>The Orca in different cultures</h1>
      <h2>First Nation</h2>
      <p>The killer whale is one of the main clans in Tsimshian culture, alonside the raven, eagle and wolf.
      <p>Haida regarded killer whales as the most powerful animals in the ocean. They have stories of killer whales living in houses and towns under the sea and people who were submerged in water would see them as humans and those who died of drowning would go on to live with them.</p>
      <p>Kwakiutl people (Vancouver Island area) regarded the killer whale as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors.</p>
      <h2>Siberian Yupiks</h2>
      <p>The Siberian Yupiks said killer whales appear as wolves in the winter and wolves appear as killer whales in the summer.
      </p>
      <h2>Western culture</h2>
      <p>In many western cultures, killer whales were feared as dangerous, savage predators.</p>

      <p>With the very few confirmed attacks on humans by <u>wild</u> killer whales, none have been fatal.</p>
